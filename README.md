# MCP-Server-with-HTTPS-and-GitHub-OAuth
This project is a secure MCP server built with Node.js and Express. It features HTTPS encryption using self-signed certificates, GitHub OAuth authentication, and additional security measures like rate limiting and HTTP header protection.
## Features
- **HTTPS Encryption**: Ensures secure communication between clients and the server.
- **GitHub OAuth Authentication**: Allows users to log in using their GitHub accounts.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects against abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
